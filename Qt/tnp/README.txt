[Short Description]

Test TCP Client and Test TCP Server written in C++ Language, with Graphical User Interface (GUI) provided by the Qt Framework.

[Description]

This an Example of Qt Program. It is written in the C++ Programming Language with an Attempt to conform the Qt Coding Style (with some Exceptions). It is not a specialized Network Application. Instead, it is just a simple Example of what can be done with the Help of the Qt Framework and C++ Programming Language. This Program uses Qt GUI Features (Widgets), various Qt Object Classes (including Containers), Qt Threads, Qt Networking Classes, and, of Course, Qt's 'Signals & Slots' Mechanism (the most valuable Feature of the Framework).

The Program consists of two Parts: the Server Part, and the Client Part. There is also a small Piece of fast written Code in Go Language testing the Server's Stress Load. Once again, this Application is not intended to handle many simultaneous Connections at a Time. It is just an Example of Qt Framework Usage.
