This is an Example of JSON-RPC Server written in Go programming Language.

The Example is done according to the Task, described in the File 'TASK'.

This Program is intended for testing Purposes only!

The Server uses its own built-in File DataBase (D.B.) which is faster than any external SQL DataBase. The main Activity is done in the Memory of the Process which is the Reason for excellent Speed. Server periodically saves the Data to the File. The Saves are done incrementally. Each Record in the D.B. has a fixed Size making Alteration of Records very rapid and secure!

In this Implementation, Server's Shutdown is not graceful. Also, the automated Tests are not full.

Some Tests are written in '*_test.go' Files. They do some basic Testing of the User Model. Other Tests may be done manually. Examples of test Clients can be found in 'test' Folder.
