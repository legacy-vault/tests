# Git Strangeness.
#
# Sometimes 'git' shows unexpected Surprises.
# For Example, it may show a List of 'Changes not staged for commit',
# which consists of old deleted Files, which were moved to another
# Folder. To delete these Files we can use a following Trick.

# Enlist the Files.
git status | grep deleted | sed 's#^.*:##' > /tmp/1.txt

# Check the List, modify it and save it to '2.txt'.
#...

# Remove the Files.
git rm --cached `cat /tmp/2.txt`

# Commit Changes and push to the Repository.
git commit -m "Files Move"
git push
