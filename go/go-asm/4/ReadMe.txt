This is a Test Case proving one simple Fact, that many Go Language Programmers are afraid to understand. The Variable Visibility Scope is set by the Compiler and Integrated Development Environment (I.D.E., the Editor). If you look at the Machine Level Code, it will remain the same.

This Example shows that for the Machine there is no Difference of where the declare Variables 'i' and 'j'. The Program Code is the same. The Variable Scope is only for the End-User, not for the CPU.

If you do not believe, you can run 'magic.sh' BASH Script and check the Difference between the two compiled Executables.
