//	Notes about the Program.												  //

//============================================================================//

1.	The Coding style is not usual, not as in popular Go programming Language.
	
	Most Parts of the Code have Comments providing easy Code Reading and 
	Understanding. 
	
	Functions are separated between each other with a Line.
	
	Function Names use 'Underscore' Symbols as in good old C programming 
	Language. Such an Approach makes it easy to distinguish Function from other 
	Identifiers (such as Variables, Constants, ...).
	
	Variables' Names use 'CamelCase' combining small and capital Letters.
	
	Inside the Functions, all the Variables used are declared at the top Part of 
	the Function Code and are sorted alphabetically. As opposed to usual Go 
	Coding Style with fast Declarations using the ':=' which make a Mess, my 
	Approach makes it very easy and fast to find any of the used Variables in 
	just a few Seconds without scrolling all the Function's Code.

2.	Seems like the 'gotk3' Library (and GTK itself) is not compatible with 
	multiple Threads. The graphical Interfaces crashes randomly in any part of 
	the Code ever possible.
