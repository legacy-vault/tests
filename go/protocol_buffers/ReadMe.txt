This Folder contains two simple Tests of the Google's "Protocol Buffers" Format.

1. The Folder '1' contains a simple Test of Data Serialization and Data De-Serialization.

2. The Folder '2' contains a simple Test of Google's RPC (gRPC) Server Usage. The Code includes a Data Model, an RPC Client and an RPC Server.

Notes.

To test gRPC Servers in real Life it is much easier to use normal Tools with human-friendly GUI, rather than spend Hours writing Clients from Scratch. At the Moment of this File Creation I have found one such Tool. It is named "BloomRPC".

Google's "Protocol Buffers" Format is not the best One in the World, but it is the One which is now used in those Companies which support the Google Corporation.

If you want to have a very fast Data Transmission Protocol, you have to invent it yourself.

Google's "Protocol Buffers" may be good in the following Cases:

	1. The Speed is not critical for you (you do not use large Data Transmission);
	2. You are lazy to create something yourself;
	3. You want to have a Tool for a generic Data Trasmission.
