Notes.

The Client must be run from the same Host Name as the WebSocket Server.
I.e. if you run Server on 'localhost', you should put both Client's Files 
('client.html' and 'a.js') to your local Web Server's public Folder and open it 
via the Web Server (set URL as 'localhost/bla-bla-bla/client.html'), not just 
from the Folder in File Manager. This should be done while the WebSocket Server 
checks the Origin of the Request and throws a '403' Error if the Host Name is 
wrong.
