This is an Example of JSON-RPC Server written in Go programming Language.

The Example is done according to the Task, described in the File 'TASK'.

This Program is intended for testing Purposes only!
It lack some Features which increase Performance and so it is not ideal.

For Example, in this Implementation, there are no Indexes for 'login' Field, also the Code lacks graceful Shutdown of the Server. Moreover, the automated Tests are not full. 

Some Tests are written in '*_test.go' Files. They do some basic Testing. Other Tests may be done manually. Examples of test Client Methods can be found in the 'TEST' File in the Folder 'test'.
